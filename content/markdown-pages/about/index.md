## About me
Hi, I'm Wyatt Childers, although, you may have also heard of me by the alias,
Dark Arc.

### Professionally

Currently, I'm a Software Engineer at Lock3 Software working on implementing
C++ constexpr reflection and metaprogramming, with a heavy focus
on the clang C++ compiler frontend.

Prior to this work, I was at Patriot Software working as a full stack
web developer primarily in Ruby on Rails, and AngularJS.

### Formal education

I graduated from [The University of Akron](http://uakron.edu) in May of 2016
after three years, starting in August of 2013. I have a variety of old class
projects licensed under GPL, which can be found on my GitHub page for reference,
please use them responsibly. These are not industrial grade software, and
shouldn't be used as such without proper review, by the same regard, be smart,
if you're a student, don't try to use these projects in your
class -- especially verbatim -- you will get caught.

### Open source
Iâ€™ve both created, and contributed to, number of open source projects over
the years, primarily in Java, JavaScript, and C++.

### Gaming

I've been involved in, and (co-)founded several gaming groups over the years.
Most recently, I created [Pakcet Loss Gaming](https://packetloss.gg/) with
the intention to create and promote, a friendly environment of
respectful gamers.

During my time in the gaming word, I've developed a variety of software
which ranges from non-trivial game modifications, to community administrative
tools -- while this wasn't always the case, much of this work
is now open source.

### Hiking

I would consider myself an avid hiker. While there were a few years where I
didn't do much hiking. I've been hiking pretty much my entire life;
I try as much as possible to get out, go on an adventure,
explore, and see what there is to be seen.

### Linux

I started using Linux as my primary operating system early 2013.
For various reasons, I briefly had to go back to Windows for about a year,
before returning to Linux, and removing Windows from my computers in 2014.
I'm a huge fan of both [GNOME](http://gnome.org) and [KDE](http://kde.org)
software, they both have their pros and cons, and the care in recent years
exhibited by both of their communities is exceptionally evident.
I'm currently using [KDE Neon](http://neon.kde.org) as my preferred
Linux distribution -- for any KDE user, I would *highly* recommend it.
