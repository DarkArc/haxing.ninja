Game Chatter is a WebSockets based game chat integration system.

Game Chatter started as my Senior Seminar project at [The University of Akron](http://uakron.edu). It has since become a very useful too for allowing my gaming community to communicate, and interact with their fellow players even when they're not able to log into the game.

The core project is GameChatterServer which is an open source Java based project broken up into several sub projects. I currently support GameChatterServer-Sponge for integration with Minecraft via the Sponge API, and GameChatterServer-Standalone for a simple standalone WebSockets based chat.
