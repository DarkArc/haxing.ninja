description: A tool to find the optimal RuneScape server.

The RuneScape Linux client doesn't support pinging servers, to find the optimal server to connect to for low latency gameplay. Thus, this project
was created to fill that gap in functionality, and allow Linux players to find the optimial server to connect to.

Additionally, this was my first project using Rust.
