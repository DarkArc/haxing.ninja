Venom is a file upload utility that started out as a script to quickly update the server over sftp.

Venom was designed to be a file upload utility. Venom accepts json configurations files as a command line argument. These configurations files are used to define a collection of files, and the respective remote mapping.

This system is still very early in development, and in some ways suffers from its inception as a very simply sftp file sync script.
