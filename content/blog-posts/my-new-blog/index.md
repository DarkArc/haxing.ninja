title: "My New Blog"

It's been a very long time since I had a blog.
[My old blog](https://xllog.wordpress.com/) hasn't been used in
years actually (August 25th, 2011), almost 4 years ago to the day.
However, I decided it was time to make a new blog, one which
is actually nice, and maybe just *maybe* be useful to somebody somewhere.

<!-- more -->

So, without further a due, I intro my new blog, and personal site,
haxing.ninja. I'm not sure what I'll be writing about, maybe just work
on the Minecraft sever project [Skelril](/projects/skelril/), or maybe
some work on something of [sk89q](http://sk89q.com)'s, we'll see.

Regardless, hopefully it will be something a bit more intriguing than
my ramblings about [RuneScape](http://runescape.com).

There's still a lot of work to be done as far as this blog site goes as well.
The project pages need a lot of work, and the about page is still blank.
To be completely honest with you, most of this was just taken from my
work on the new Skelril website, which is currently at
[beta.skelril.com](http://beta.skelril.com)
if you're interested in looking at it.
